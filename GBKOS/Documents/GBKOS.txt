GBKOS is intending to produce a free and effective Chinese platform on Palm OS.
 
As all Chinese Palm user know, CJKOS is the only choice for Palm user who want 
to show Simplified-Chinese on Palm device. CJKOS is a greate software, but it 
has its flaws. It does not support GBK, the most frequently used charset in China
mainland. And most of most, it's expensive, at least for people in Chinese Mainland.

To solve the first problem, there's hacked CJKOS to support GBK. But GBKOS is 
going to be an all-in-one solution for Simplified-Chinese Palm user, and it is
FREE.

We will make it on OS 4, which we know well enough to create a Chinese platform.
Hope there will be OS 5 version.
