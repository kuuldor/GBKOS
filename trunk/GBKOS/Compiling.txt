There's two directories containing source code.

./src is the source code of kernel library and DA tools.
Use prc-tools 2.2 and Palm sdk-4(4.1 patch is needed) and Sony SDK rel3.0 to compile ./src.
If you are a tyro with prc-tools, please do the following:
cd src
make clean; make

when compiling is over, there will be GBKOS_Lib.prc and GBKOS_DA.prc.

./Console is the project of CodeWarrior 9 for GBKOS Console, which is to control GBKOS's behavior.
Install CW9 and open Console.mcp with it, then build.
The first time build will have errors like "GBKOS_Rsc.h cannot be opened".
It's ok, for the resource has not been compiled to generate the header file.
Then build it again and it will go to the end with some warnings about POL.
Just ignore the warnings.
The GBKOS.prc will be in the directory of Release or Debug, depending on which
setting you choose to build.
